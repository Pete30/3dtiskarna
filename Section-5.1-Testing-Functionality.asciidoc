You have almost finished building your printer. Now we will test if all the connections are correct. 

**Testing Temperature**

* Turn on the printer. Check if the fans on the side of the hotends are working.
* In the display menu push the button once and navigate to: _>Prepare >Preheat PLA >Preheat PLA All_ or if you have a single extruder _>Preheat PLA 1_
* Wait until the menu jumps back to the info screen and check if the temperatures of the nozzles and the heatbed are rising. 
** You don't have to wait until the temperature reaches it's goal value. 
* In the mean time navigate to: _>Control >Temperature >Fan Speed_ and turn it up to 255 and confirm with a push on the button. The active fan on the back of the extruder should turn on now. 
* Load some filament by navigating to _>Utilities >Load Extruder0_ 
** The left extruder will heat up automatically now, once it's hot the filament pulley will start turning. 
** Put in some filament until some is extruded. 
** Push the button to stop.
** If the filament pulley turns the wrong direction turn around the connector on the RUMBA board. 
* Do the same for the right extruder with _>Utilities >Load Ext. 1_


**Testing Motion**

* Turn on the printer. In the display menu navigate to: _>Prepare >Move Axis >Move 10 mm >Move X_ and turn the knob some steps in clockwise direction. The printhead should now move to the right. 
** If the printhead moves to the left you should turn the connector by 180Â° on the RUMBA.
* Do the same for the Y-Axis. The print platform should move to the front. 
* The same for the Z-Axis. Choose _>Move 1mm_ instead of _>Move 10mm_ in the Move Axis menu. The X-Bridge should move up.
** Note the printer will refuse to move in a negative direction as long as it hasn't detected the endstops. 

* Test the endstops again by manually moving the axis to it. 
** To move the axis by hand navigate to _>Prepare >Disable Steppers_. This will set the motors free.
* If you are sure that all the endstops work navigate to _>Prepare >Auto Home_ the printer will now home all axes. 
** Keep your finger at the power switch when you do this for the first time. If the Z-Axis fails to detect the endstop the motors can potentially destroy some parts of the printer.  

* If everything worked correctly your printer works. Next is some simple mechanical adjustments.
