* Hold the heatbed on the left side of the y-carriage as shown in the picture above
* Fix the braided sleeve of the heatbed cable to the back of the y-carriage with a zip tie
* Lay down the heatbed and organize the cable so that the wires are neatly underneath the heatbed.

Heatbed Power Connection
|====

* Connect the heatbed to the RUMBA
** Fix the cable in such a way that it does not obstruct the movement of the Y-Axis. 
** Probably the cable runs smoothest if guided between the M10 rod and the smooth rod. 
** Experiment with how to fix the cable with zipties for optimal movement.
