|====

* Put double sided tape on the shiny side of the Z Motor Covers, and attach them to it.
** Alternative to double sided tape is plastic glue. Use only a little bit of it, so it is possible to remove the plate at some point in the future in case it is necessary. 
* Push the smooth rods into the Z-Motor holders.
** If it goes to stiff, use a handdrill to turn them in. Do not use a hammer. 
* Place the X-Bridge onto the smooth rods. Mind that the little hook on the X-Idler holder will be on the back side of the aliminium plate. 
* Carefully turn the ACME rods into the Nuts.
* Put double sided tape on the shiny side of the X-Motor Cover and the X-Idler cover. Stick them onto the corresponding parts. The matte side should be visible. 
* Push the Z-Top parts onto the smooth rods.
** Mind that the shiny side of the printed parts is on the top. 
* Mount the top parts with the Torx screws. The long screws are in the outer holes.
* Put double sided tape on the shiny side of the Z-Top part covers and stick them onto the parts.
