You made the main units. After wiring up the Y-Unit you will put them together. While you're at it, just wire everything, including preparing the wiring for the extruder and the heatbed, that you will assemble later. 
We prefer organized wiring over spaghetti. It is important how you put the cables, so have a good look at all the nice 3D renders we made.
