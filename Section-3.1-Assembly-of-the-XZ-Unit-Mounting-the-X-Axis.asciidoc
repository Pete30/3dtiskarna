1x 8mm Smooth Rod
|====

* Put the linear bearings onto any of the smooth rods
** This is to keep the bearings straight while you mount them.
* Put the bearings and the rod into the bearing slots of the X-Motor
* Put the ACME Nut into the slot of the X-Motor Holder
** You can find the ACME Nut on the threaded rod of your linear stepper motor
* Place the Bearing Holder
* Fix the Bearing Holder with the two Torx screws.
* Remove the smooth rod

* Mount the pulley onto the motor shaft.
* Fix it with the two little set screws that you can find in the white bag in your RUMBA electronics box.
* The distance between the motor and the pulley is 4.5mm.

1x 8mm Smooth Rod
|====

* Put the linear bearings onto a smooth rod
* Put the linear bearings with the smooth rod into the pocket for the bearings
* Put the ACME Nut in position
* Place the bearing holder
* Fix it with two M3x16 Torx screws
* Remove the rod
* Note: the bearings can move left and right a couple of millimeters (with some friction). This is to avoid load on the bearings that can be caused by tolerances in the length of the linear rods of the X-Axis.

|====

* Pierce the holes in the X-Carriage.
** The hole is closed of with one print layer for good print results. You can easily pierce it by pushing with a small allen key or screw driver from the other side. 
* Slide the X-Teeth into position
* Fix the teeth with the screws.

* Place the upper two bearings into their slots
* Slide a smooth rod through the bearings
* Mount the upper two bearings with a ziptie. Mind the orientation of the head. 
** If you don't have a big ziptie, fix it with TWO small zipties for better stability.
* Remove the smooth rod
* Push in the lower linear bearing
* Mount it with a ziptie.

1x 8mm x 343 Smooth Rod
|====

* Slide the long (400mm) smooth rod into the upper hole of the X-Motor holder
** Make sure it reaches to the end. 
** If it goes too stiff you can put the end into a hand drill. Do not use a hammer.  
* Slide the short smooth rod in the the X-Motor holder
* Slide the X-Carriage assembly onto the rods. Mind the orientation!
* Slide the X-Idler onto the smooth rods. Again make sure that they reach until the end of the hole.
** If it goes stiff make a light twisting movement with you hands while you push the plastic parts more and more together.
