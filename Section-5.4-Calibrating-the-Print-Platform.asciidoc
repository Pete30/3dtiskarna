* The mirror should be well adjusted to the nozzle. 
* Turn the adjust nuts about 1cm height.
* First home. Disable the steppers. Move the nozzle above the heatbed by hand. 
* If the nozzle is (for example) about 5mm above the heatbed, put the Z-Endstop about 4mm down.
* Home again until the nozzle is about 1mm above the mirror. 
* Move the printbed and nozzle in the position close to the left adjusting point

* Put a piece of paper under the nozzle
** I there is some plastic drip under the nozzle caused by previous prints, heat up the nozzle to printing temperature.

* As a last check up check the front and back left corner. If there is a big difference you should repeat link:wiki/Section-5.2-Calibrating-the-Y-Axis[Calibrating the Y-Axis] again or try to solve it with the paper trick.
