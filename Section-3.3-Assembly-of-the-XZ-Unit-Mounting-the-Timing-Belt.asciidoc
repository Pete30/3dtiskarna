1x Belt Tensioner
|====

* Put the bearing onto the M4 screw with a Belt Guiding Disc on both sides
** Make sure that the little notch of the discs is facing the bearing. The smooth surface is facing outwards.
* Lead the timing belt throught the opening of the X-Idler holder.
* Put the bearing assembly throught the loop
* Pull it back into the X-Idler holder.
** You just slide in the idler bearing with screw from the side. No need to screw anything, the tension of the belt will keep the bearing in its place.

* Push one end of the timing belt into the teeth of the X-Axis
* Lead the remaining long side through the opening underneath the Teeth.
* Loosen the screws of the X-Motor a little bit, and slide the motor some millimeters in the direction of the X-Carriage.
* Lead the timing belt over the motor pulley 
* Lead it back into the direction of the X-Carriage.
* Put the Belt Tensioner on the belt as shown.
* Push the remaining end of the timing belt into the X-Teeth. 
* Set the tension not too tight.
* Tighten the timing belt by sliding the motor to the right and fix it again with its screws. 
** If the belt moves up and down a little when you move the X-Carriage the belt is too loose
** If the belt makes sound like a guitar string, it is too tight.
* If the belt tensioner is (almost) straight as shown the tension is right.
