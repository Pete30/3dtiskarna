* Double check the electrical connections 
* If you are sure that everything is right you can connect the power to the printer
* Some LED's should start blinking and probably your axes will start moving. 
** The moving axes are a bit in the way for what we are going to do, so disconnect all the motors for the moment.

* Check if all the endstops light green.
** You have to look well, because we've hidden the bright light underneath the acrylic cover.
* Look for the little magnets that came with the endstops.
* Put one magnet on a little allen key, and move it under the endstop sensor.
** If the light turns of the orientation is correct
** If nothing happens, turn around the magnet and try again.
* Mark the orientation.

* Put a drop of 1 second super glue into the magnet slot of the Y-Teeth
* Put the magnet into the slot in the correct orientation.
** Tip: you can easily get the magnet from the allen key with aid of the blue white ceramic screwdriver that came with your RUMBA.
* Test if the green light turns of if you move the Y-Carriage underneath the end stop.

* Flip over the printer so you can easily reach the X magnet slot.
* Just as with the Y magnet, find the right orientation of the magnet
* Glue it with a drop of 1 second super glue and test if it works correctly.

* Leave the printer up side down and glue the Z-EndStop.
* Put back the printer on its feet again
* Turn down the X-Bridge manually by turning the Z-Motors with your hands. Try to keep the X-Bridge somewhat straight. 
* Check if the endstop works correctly.
