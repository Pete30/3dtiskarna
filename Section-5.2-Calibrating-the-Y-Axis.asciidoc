* Slide the y-carriage all the way to the back.
* Put the mirror up side down on the smoothrods.
* Tap the diagonally opposing corners and see if they make sound ticking on the smooth rods. 
* If so, the rods of the Y-Axis are not parallel and you need adjust it. 
** Do so by turning the screw of the Y-Height adjuster up or down. 
** Adjust it until the rods are parallel to the mirror.
