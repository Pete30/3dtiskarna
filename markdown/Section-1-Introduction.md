**About RepRap**

Welcome to this i3 Berlin building manual. Throughout this manual we are
going to build and adjust the i3 Berlin 3D printer all the way through.

But before we start doing anything we want to explain you the power and
principles of open hardware, which we will illustrate with a brief
history of the RepRap project.

**i3 Berlin Design overview**

3D printers come in many varieties. There are around 400 different open
source models in circulation. We took the i3 design of Josef Prusa. This
has been designed especially for easy assembly and is a comfortable
all-round 3D printer to start with. We changed the original open design
quite a bit, but essentially it is still the same printer.

Our *i3 Berlin* has further improved the ease of assembly. We made the
looks more consistent and clean. We also added some extra functionality
like easy folding mechanism, display and electronics casing. What you
cannot see from the pictures is the effort we put in debugging the
mechanical parts. We have tested the parts over and over again, so we
are really sure that everything fits seamlessly.
