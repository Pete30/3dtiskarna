You made the main units. After wiring up the Y-Unit you will put them
together. While youâ€™re at it, just wire everything, including preparing
the wiring for the extruder and the heatbed, that you will assemble
later. We prefer organized wiring over spaghetti. It is important how
you put the cables, so have a good look at all the nice 3D renders we
made.
