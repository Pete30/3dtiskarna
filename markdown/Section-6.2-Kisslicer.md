Kisslicer stands for keep it simple slicer. It is a freemium financed
proprietory software. The free version will probably suffice for your
needs. The \$42 pro version unlocks features such as dual printing and
stacked infill.

Kisslicer produces very nice looking gcode, although it performs poorly
with thin walls and bridging. The supports are very pleasant and come of
much more easily than cura supports, although the cura developers are
catching up.

Install the program as described in our
[git](https://github.com/open3dengineering/i3_Berlin/tree/master/Software/KISSlicer)
and overwrite the .ini files with our settings.
