You will start the assembly with glueing the casings for the RUMBA controller electronics and the display. Since the glue needs time to dry it's to best to have this done now. 

Please don't use 1 second cyano-acrylat superglue for glueing the acrylic and printed parts, because they will probably cause ugly white stains.

1x RUMBA Case Cable Inlet
|====

* Look for the RUMBA Case Bottom part in the bag of acrylic parts.
** Remove the protective film on the shiny side of the acrylic.
* The Cable Inlet can be found in the bag of printed parts. 
* Stick the parts together in such a way that the printed part is flush with the engraved side of the acrylic part. 
* If the parts are not fixed well, apply some plastic glue in the corners. 
** Mind that the matt side of the acrylic is going to be the visual outside of the casing, so prevent glue stains here.

* Remove the protection film on the shiny side of the acrylic.
** Leave the protection film of the matt side in place as much a possible to prevent scratches and glue stains.
* Connect the parts as shown above with the shiny part on top.
* Take a good look at the image. Apply a line of glue in such a way that it will always stay inside of the casing to prevent stains.

1x 40mm Fan
|====

* Glue the FanHolder on the shiny side of the RUMBA Case Lid. 
** Putting the fan first helps aliging the position of the fan holder
** Note that the fan should NOT be glued to anything
** The fan can be found in the box of the RAMPS electronics
** Putting the sticker of the fan towards the outlet is recommended. Like that it will suck out are from the casing instead of blowing it in. An airstream like this reduces dust accumulations. 
** You can leave the fan. 
* The casing is now finished. The remaining parts will be glued later in the wiring section.
