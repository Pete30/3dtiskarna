* Connect the extruder motor with the remaining motor cables of 1 meter long.
* Label all the wires in such a way that you will know which connector belongs to which wire. 
** Note: the left extruder is numbered "0", the right extruder is numbered "1".
** Label all four heater cables as HE0 or HE1
** Label the motor cables as E0 and E1
** Label the termistor cables as T0 and T1
** Label the Active fan as A-Fan
** Label the Extruder cooler fans as E-Fan
* Lead all the wires through the thick braided sleeve. 
* Fix the braided sleeve onto the extruder unit with a zip tie.

* Lead the cable into the RUMBA case through the side inlet. 
* Connect the wires accordingly to the picture above. Detailed pictures will follow below.

* Connect the heaters to the HE0 and HE1.
** Polarity is not important.

* Connect the extruder motors to E0 and E1.
** Note that the connectors are in a mirrored ordered. 
** In case the brand of the extruder motor is "Moons" note that the wire order is black red green blue or red yellow grey green.

* Connect the Active Fan to the Fan 0
** Note that the red wire is on the positive and the negative on the black
* Connect the Extruder Fan(s) to the 12V output.
** If you are building a dual extruder you will probably see a double wire for each pin.
** Connect the red wire to the positive and the black to negative.

* Put the extruder unit on a heat resistant surface.
* Turn on the printer. 
* In the display menu push the button once and turn it to navigate to Control. 
* Continue to Temperature and Nozzle 0. And set the temperature to 150 degrees Celsius. Push the button once more to confirm. 
* The nozzle heats up now (be careful).
** Note the first time the extruder heats up it produces some burning smells. This is nothing to worry about and also something that will soon go away. 
* Wait until the temperature is stable for some minutes. Then increase the temperature to 280°C. 
* Wait until the temperature is reached and carefully fix the nozzle with a 17mm and 8mm wrench as shown above. 
* Let it cool down. Now test again if the heater still works (sometimes they break) by putting the temperature to 150°C (the nozzle should be colder than 150°C of course). If it heats up than everything is fine. If not, you'll have to replace the heat cartridge. 
* Do the same for the right hand extruder.

* Put the extruder unit onto the X-Carriage.
* Make sure that the cavity on the back of the cooling duct stands on the notch of the X-Carriage 
* Fix the unit with the two screws

1x Cable Holder Cover
|====

* Put the braided sleeve into the opening of the Cable Holder. 
** Take care that the length is enough so the extruder can reach easily to the far right. 
** 
* Put the cable holder onto the X-Motor
* Join the wires of the X into the braided sleeve. 
* If the wires are entangled too much, reconnect them in such a way that all cables are neatly organized.
