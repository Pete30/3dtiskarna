Kisslicer stands for keep it simple slicer. It is a freemium financed proprietory software. The free version will probably suffice for your needs. The $42 pro version unlocks features such as dual printing and stacked infill. 

Kisslicer produces very nice looking gcode, although it performs poorly with thin walls and bridging. The supports are very pleasant and come of much more easily than cura supports, although the cura developers are catching up. 

Install the program as described in our https://github.com/laydrop/i3_Berlin/tree/master/Software/KISSlicer[git] and overwrite the .ini files with our settings.
