* Lead all the power wires through the opening of the Power Supply Cover
* Connect the red wires to the 12V+
* Connect the black wires to the 12V-
* Connect the green/yellow cable to the GND, recognizable by the symbol of a striped arrow pointing downwards. 
* Connect the brown high voltage cable to the L
* Connect the blue high voltage cable to the N
* Check again if everything is correct and that there is no chance for electrical short circuits. 
* Make the screws really tight.

* Close the left hand front nut and the flange nut
* Always keep looking that the XZ-Plate is parallel to the Y-Carriage
* Tighten the left hand nuts completely and lock it with the rear M10 nut. 
* Congratulations! It suddenly looks much more like a 3D printer!

2 x Spacer
|====

* Plug in the flatband cables
* There is a black mark on the PCB of the RUMBA, this is where the notch of the connector should be. Also mind the orientation of the red wire as shown in the picture above.
* Fold the flatband cables so they both leave neatly through the opening in the RUMBA Case
* Mount the RUMBA with its case to the frame with the two screws.
** Put the two spacers between the RUMBA and the case.
