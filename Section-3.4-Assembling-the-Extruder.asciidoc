Finally it is time to build the extruder. The design of the extruder is made to be a dual extruder, but you can also make it a single extruder by leaving out the right hand motor and hotend.

1x M3x3 Set Screw
|====

* Turn the set screw into the filament pulley
* Fix the filament pulley onto the motor shaft
* Make sure that: 
** The screw is on the front
** The screw touches the flat side of the motor shaft
** The front of the pulley and the motor shaft are flush
* For a dual extruder, prepare two motors

4x M3x20 Screw
|====

* Make sure the filament path is free. Test it with a piece of filament.
* Put the plastic parts onto the assembly, but do not tighten the screws yet
* For single extruder put the right plastic part later, and fix it with the aluminium plate

2x Extruder Spring
|====

* Slide the extruder springs behind the plastic part. 
* Push them all the way in, with the aid of the other extruder springs.

2x Extruder Spring
|====

* Slide the remaining two extruder springs behind the heads of the M3x20 screws
* Tighten the screws (but not too tight!!)
** The ball bearing is (almost) touching the filament pulley

4x Torx 3 x 16 Screw
|====


* Click the radial fan into the designated slots of the extruder fanholder part
** Lead the wire through the cable channel
* Mount the fans onto the extruder fanholder
** Make sure the wires for the fans are soldered so the fans are powered with 1 connector
** Lead the cables through the cable channel

2x E3D Heater Block
|

2x E3D Nozzle
|====

* Screw the Heatbreak and the nozzle into the Heater Block
** Handtight is well enough
* Screw the cooler body onto the Heatbreak
** Make it tight, but only hand tight
** Understand that the heatbreak has a very thin 'neck' which can be damaged with a too high force

|====

* Adjust the nozzle in such a way that there is just a couple of tenths of a millimeter between the heater block and the head of the nozzle.
** The neck of the heat break should be more or less flush with the top of the heater block
** Everything is fixed, but only hand tight
** Later the nozzle will be fixed while the hotend is heated to 300Â°C. This is to make sure the nozzle is press fit to the heat break
** Fixing the nozzle like this also reduces mechanical load on the heat break while fixing the nozzle

2x M3 Set Screw
|====

* Slide the heat cartridge into the hole of the heater block
** The left side of the cartridge should be flush with the heater block
** Gently fix it with the set screw
** In a dual set up the cartridges are mirrored. Use the picture of the next step as a reference
* Slide the thermistor into the little hole
** Make sure the thermistor is (more or less) in the middle 
** Bend the leads so it cannot slide
** Bend the leads together so you can connect it later with a connector.

2x FanDuct

|====

* Put the hotends onto the extruder base plate
* Connect the thermistors. Polarity is not important
* Lead the wires through the wire channel
* Lead the wires of the heat cartridges through the wire channel
* Fix the hotends with the aluminium front-plates
** The right hotend can slide some millimeters in it slot.
** Mount it as far up as possible. The exact height will be adjusted later. 
* Mount the fan duct in front of the hotends with the torx screws
