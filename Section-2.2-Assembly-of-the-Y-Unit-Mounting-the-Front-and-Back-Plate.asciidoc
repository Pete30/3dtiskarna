|====

* Put the front plate onto the threaded rods.
* Put the round nuts to the M10 Threaded rods. Do not fix the front plate yet. 
* Firmly hold the M10 rod and fix the round nut onto the M10 rod.
* The front plate should still be loose now.

2x Round Nut
|====

* In general be careful with the aluminium parts and prevent scratches by putting a towel on the table. 
* Test if the smooth rods can enter the hole in the aluminium plates. The holes in the aluminium plates are very accurate and the smooth rods might have a little bur from cutting them. If they don't fit, carefully file of the edge of the rods a little bit until they all fit.
* Put the linear bearings to the rods.
* Put the Y-Motor Holder and the Y-Back Left part to the M10 threaded rods
* Put the smooth rods to the front plate. 
** Mind that the right hand rod has two bearings, the left rod only one.
** Make sure that the left hand rod enters the slot hole in the front plate through the slot hole of the Y-Height adjuster. With the height adjuster you will later make the two smooth rods perfectly parallel.
* Put the Back Plate to the M10 Rods. 
* Tighten the round nuts and the corresponding M10 nuts in such a way that the back plate is nice and straight.

The result looks like this:

* If you are having difficulties to make the unit straight try what happens when you loosen the M4 screw on the Power Supply, make the unit straight and fix it again.
