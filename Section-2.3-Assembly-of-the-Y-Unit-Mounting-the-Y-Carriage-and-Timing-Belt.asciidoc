3x Ziptie
|====

* Mount the Y-Carriage onto the linear bearings with zipties. 
* Mind the orientation of all parts
* Cut off the loose ends of the zipties. 
* Check if the Y-Carriage can move smoothly. It should move by gravity if you tilt the Y-Unit.

* Put the belt tensioner on the belt as shown in the picture above.
* Put the other end of timing belt into the Y-Teeth.
* The tension should not be too loose nor too tight
** Too loose: you see the belt moving up and down at the idler when you move the Y-Carriage
** Too tight: the belt makes sound like a guitar string. 
* In all cases it is better to have the belt a bit too tight than too loose. 
* The belt tensioner should be (almost) straight as shown in the image.
